  image: 2024_PNAS_Jin.png
  description: Simultaneous testing of multiple genes is important for applications such as pathogen identification. Such testing has primarily relied on fluorescence labeling that are complicated and costly. To achieve that in a label-free manner, here we report a method, named StratoLAMP, using the inherently generated precipitate in isothermal amplification as the detecting feature. By specially designing the amplification system, droplets encapsulating different nucleic acid targets exhibited different levels of precipitates, which were accurately stratified to infer the encapsulated targets using deep learning image analysis. We demonstrated the capability of the StratoLAMP in simultaneous quantification of two nucleic acid targets within the samples. By eliminating the need for fluorescence, the StratoLAMP holds great application potential for nucleic acid quantification in resource-limited settings.

  authors: Kai Wu,# Qi Fang,# Zhantao Zhao, and <b>Zida Li</b>*
  description: Multiplex, digital nucleic acid tests have important biomedical applications, but existing methods mostly use fluorescent probes that are target-specific and difficult to optimize, limiting their widespread applications. Here, we report color-encoded, intelligent digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (CoID-LAMP) for the coidentification of multiple nucleic acid targets. CoID-LAMP supplements different primer solutions with different dyes, generates primer droplets and sample droplets, and collectively pairs these two types of droplets in a microwell array device to perform LAMP. After imaging, the droplet colors were analyzed to decode the primer information, and the precipitate byproducts within droplets were detected to determine the target occupancy and calculate the concentrations. We first established an image analysis pipeline based on a deep learning algorithm for reliable droplet detection and validated the analytical performance in nucleic acid quantification. We then implemented CoID-LAMP using fluorescent dyes as the coding materials and established an 8-plex digital nucleic acid assay, confirming the reliable coding performance and the capability of multiplex nucleic acid quantification. We further implemented CoID-LAMP using brightfield dyes for a 4-plex assay, suggesting that the assay could be realized solely by brightfield imaging with minimal demand on the optics. Leveraging the advantages of droplet microfluidics in multiplexing and deep learning in intelligent image analysis, CoID-LAMP offers a useful tool for multiplex nucleic acid quantification.

  description: Combinatorial drug therapy reduces drug resistance and disease relapse, but informed drug combinations are lacking due to the high scale of possible combinations and the relatively simple phenotyping strategies. Here we report combinatorial perturbation sequencing (CP-seq) on single cells using microwell-base droplet random pairing. CP-seq uses oligonucleotides to barcode drugs, encapsulates drugs and cells in separate droplets, and pairs cell droplets with two drug droplets randomly on a microwell array chip to complete combinatorial drug treatment and barcode-tagging on cells. The subsequent single-cell RNA sequencing simultaneously detects the single-cell transcriptomes and drug barcodes to demultiplex the corresponding drug treatment. The microfluidic droplet operations had robust performance, with the overall utilization rate of the microwells being up to 83%. We then progressively validated the CP-seq by performing single-drug treatments and then combinatorial-drug treatments, confirming the CP-seq's capability in the collection and analysis of drug-perturbed transcriptomes. Leveraging the advantage of droplet microfluidics in massive multiplexing, the CP-seq represents a great technology for combinatorial perturbation screening with high throughput and comprehensive profiling.

  description: Digital nucleic acid amplification tests enable absolute quantification of nucleic acids, but the generation of uniform compartments and reading of the fluorescence requires specialized instruments that are costly, limiting their widespread applications. Here, the authors report deep learning-enabled polydisperse emulsion-based digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification (deep-dLAMP) for label-free, low-cost nucleic acid quantification. deep-dLAMP performs LAMP reaction in polydisperse emulsions and uses a deep learning algorithm to segment and determine the occupancy status of each emulsion in images based on precipitated byproducts. The volume and occupancy data of the emulsions are then used to infer the nucleic acid concentration based on the Poisson distribution. deep-dLAMP can accurately predict the sizes and occupancy status of each emulsion and provide accurate measurements of nucleic acid concentrations with a limit of detection of 5.6 copies µl-1 and a dynamic range of 37.2 to 11000 copies µl-1. In addition, deep-dLAMP shows robust performance under various parameters, such as the vortexing time and image qualities. Leveraging the state-of-the-art deep learning models, deep-dLAMP represents a significant advancement in digital nucleic acid tests by significantly reducing the instrument cost. We envision deep-dLAMP would be readily adopted by biomedical laboratories and be developed into a point-of-care digital nucleic acid test system.

  description: Monitoring of the coagulation function has applications in many clinical settings. Routine coagulation assays in the clinic are sample-consuming and slow in turnaround. Microfluidics provides the opportunity to develop coagulation assays that are applicable in point-of-care settings, but reported works required bulky sample pumping units or costly data acquisition instruments. In this work, we developed a microfluidic coagulation assay with a simple setup and easy operation. The device continuously generated droplets of blood sample and buffer mixture and reported the temporal development of blood viscosity during coagulation based on the color appearance of the resultant droplets. We characterized the relationship between blood viscosity and color appearance of the droplets and performed experiments to validate the assay results. In addition, we developed a prototype analyzer equipped with simple fluid pumping and economical imaging module and obtained similar assay measurements. This assay showed great potential to be developed into a point-of-care coagulation test with practical impact.

  description: Early human embryonic development involves extensive lineage diversification, cell-fate specification and tissue patterning1. Despite its basic and clinical importance, early human embryonic development remains relatively unexplained owing to interspecies divergence2,3 and limited accessibility to human embryo samples. Here we report that human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a microfluidic device recapitulate, in a highly controllable and scalable fashion, landmarks of the development of the epiblast and amniotic ectoderm parts of the conceptus, including lumenogenesis of the epiblast and the resultant pro-amniotic cavity, formation of a bipolar embryonic sac, and specification of primordial germ cells and primitive streak cells. We further show that amniotic ectoderm-like cells function as a signalling centre to trigger the onset of gastrulation-like events in hPSCs. Given its controllability and scalability, the microfluidic model provides a powerful experimental system to advance knowledge of human embryology and reproduction. This model could assist in the rational design of differentiation protocols of hPSCs for disease modelling and cell therapy, and in high-throughput drug and toxicity screens to prevent pregnancy failure and birth defects.

  description: Despite its importance in central nervous system development, development of the human neural tube (NT) remains poorly understood, given the challenges of studying human embryos, and the developmental divergence between humans and animal models. We report a human NT development model, in which NT-like tissues, neuroepithelial (NE) cysts, are generated in a bioengineered neurogenic environment through self-organization of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). NE cysts correspond to the neural plate in the dorsal ectoderm and have a default dorsal identity. Dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning of NE cysts is achieved using retinoic acid and/or sonic hedgehog and features sequential emergence of the ventral floor plate, P3, and pMN domains in discrete, adjacent regions and a dorsal territory progressively restricted to the opposite dorsal pole. This hPSC-based, DV patterned NE cyst system will be useful for understanding the self-organizing principles that guide NT patterning and for investigations of neural development and neural disease.

# - title: "Imaging moiré deformation and dynamics in twisted bilayer graphene"
#   image: TBG_SL.png
#   description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.

#   image: Direct.png
#   authors: I Battisti, WO Tromp, S Riccò, RS Perry, AP Mackenzie, A Tamai, F Baumberger, MP Allan
#   description: We directly test the consistency of results from these three techniques by comparing data from the correlated metal Sr2RhO4. Using ARPES, STM, and quantum oscillations, we find good agreement for the Fermi surface topography and carrier effective masses. Hence, the apparent absence of such an agreement in other quantum materials, including the cuprates, suggests that the electronic states in these materials are of different, non-Fermi liquid-like nature.
