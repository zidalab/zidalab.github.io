  description: This study introduces a new type of ultra-sensitive protein detection method called inclusive droplet digital ELISA (iddELISA). Unlike traditional digital tests that only use droplets with one bead, this method uses all droplets—even those with multiple beads—by applying a smart statistical model. This improves both the efficiency and accuracy of detection. Demonstrated with COVID-19 nucleocapsid protein, the new method achieved detection limits far lower than existing techniques. This innovation could help in early disease diagnosis where protein levels are extremely low.

- title: "StratoLAMP: Label-free, multiplex digital loop-mediated isothermal amplification based on visual stratification of precipitate"
  image: 2024_PNAS_Jin.png
  description: We developed StratoLAMP, a new method for detecting multiple genetic targets without the need for complex or costly fluorescent labels. Instead, we use a natural byproduct from a common DNA amplification reaction—tiny particles that form during the process—as a visual signal. By carefully designing the system, we can tell which genes are present just by looking at the amount of these particles in each droplet. We then use AI-powered image analysis to interpret the results with high accuracy. StratoLAMP makes genetic testing simpler, more affordable, and better suited for use outside of high-tech labs—an exciting step toward more accessible diagnostics.

  authors: Kai Wu,# Qi Fang,# Zhantao Zhao, and <b>Zida Li</b>*
  description: This paper introduces CoID-LAMP, a new method for detecting and measuring multiple genetic materials (nucleic acids) simultaneously. Instead of using complicated fluorescent tags for each target, CoID-LAMP uses simple colored droplets and deep learning image analysis to identify and count different genetic targets. The system pairs color-coded primer droplets with sample droplets on a small chip, allowing the reaction to take place and be observed with basic imaging tools. The method works accurately with both fluorescent and non-fluorescent (brightfield) dyes, making it low-cost and user-friendly. This technology could help make genetic testing faster, easier, and more accessible.

  description: This study introduces a new technology called CP-seq, which helps researchers test combinations of drugs on individual cells. It works by tagging each drug with a unique barcode and using microfluidic devices to randomly mix drugs with cells in tiny droplets. After treatment, scientists can read both the cell's genetic response and the drug combination it received. This method allows thousands of drug combinations to be tested quickly and efficiently, offering a powerful tool for discovering better treatments and reducing drug resistance.

  description: This study introduces "deep-dLAMP," a low-cost method for quantifying nucleic acids using common lab equipment and advanced deep learning. Instead of requiring expensive tools to create uniform droplets, the method uses simple vortex mixing to produce droplets of various sizes and applies deep learning to analyze images of these droplets. It identifies whether each droplet contains a DNA amplification product by detecting visible precipitates, and then calculates the DNA concentration based on droplet size and occupancy using statistical models. This method is accurate, robust across different conditions, and has the potential to be widely used in labs or point-of-care testing.

  description: This study presents a new, easy-to-use blood testing device that measures how quickly blood clots, which is important for surgeries and managing certain diseases. The device works by mixing blood with a buffer in tiny droplets and tracking how the color of these droplets changes as the blood becomes thicker (more viscous). By analyzing the droplet colors, the system can determine the blood’s clotting behavior. The researchers also built a simple, portable version of the device, showing that it could be used outside traditional labs, such as in clinics or emergency situations.

  description: Early human embryonic development involves extensive lineage diversification, cell-fate specification and tissue patterning1. Despite its basic and clinical importance, early human embryonic development remains relatively unexplained owing to interspecies divergence2,3 and limited accessibility to human embryo samples. Here we report that human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a microfluidic device recapitulate, in a highly controllable and scalable fashion, landmarks of the development of the epiblast and amniotic ectoderm parts of the conceptus, including lumenogenesis of the epiblast and the resultant pro-amniotic cavity, formation of a bipolar embryonic sac, and specification of primordial germ cells and primitive streak cells. We further show that amniotic ectoderm-like cells function as a signalling centre to trigger the onset of gastrulation-like events in hPSCs. Given its controllability and scalability, the microfluidic model provides a powerful experimental system to advance knowledge of human embryology and reproduction. This model could assist in the rational design of differentiation protocols of hPSCs for disease modelling and cell therapy, and in high-throughput drug and toxicity screens to prevent pregnancy failure and birth defects.

  description: Despite its importance in central nervous system development, development of the human neural tube (NT) remains poorly understood, given the challenges of studying human embryos, and the developmental divergence between humans and animal models. We report a human NT development model, in which NT-like tissues, neuroepithelial (NE) cysts, are generated in a bioengineered neurogenic environment through self-organization of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). NE cysts correspond to the neural plate in the dorsal ectoderm and have a default dorsal identity. Dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning of NE cysts is achieved using retinoic acid and/or sonic hedgehog and features sequential emergence of the ventral floor plate, P3, and pMN domains in discrete, adjacent regions and a dorsal territory progressively restricted to the opposite dorsal pole. This hPSC-based, DV patterned NE cyst system will be useful for understanding the self-organizing principles that guide NT patterning and for investigations of neural development and neural disease.
